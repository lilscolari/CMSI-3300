class SalaryPredictor:
    """
    A Logistic Regression Classifier used to predict someone's salary (from LONG ago)
    based upon their demographic characteristics like education level, age, etc. This
    task is turned into a binary-classification task with two labels:
      y = 0: The individual made less than or equal to 50k
      y = 1: The individual made more than 50k
    
    [!] You are free to choose whatever attributes needed to implement the SalaryPredictor;
    unlike the ToxicityFilter, there are no constraints of what you must include here.
    """

    def __init__(self, X_train: pd.DataFrame, y_train: pd.DataFrame):
        """
        Creates a new SalaryPredictor trained on the given features from the
        preprocessed census data to predicted salary labels. Does so by:
        1. Preprocesses the training data
        2. Fits the Logistic Regression model to the transformed features
        3. Saves this model as an attribute for later use
        
        Parameters:
            X_train (pd.DataFrame):
                Pandas DataFrame consisting of the sample rows of attributes
                pertaining to each individual

        """
        Takes in the raw rows of individuals' characteristics to be used for
        salary classification and converts them into the numerical features that
        can be used both during training and classification by the LR model.
        
        Parameters:
            features [pd.DataFrame]:
                The data frame containing all inputs to be preprocessed where the
                rows are 1 per person to classify and the columns are their attributes
                that may require preprocessing, e.g., one-hot encoding the categorical
                attributes like education.
            
            training [bool]:
                Whether or not this preprocessing call is happening during training
                (i.e., in the SalaryPredictor's constructor) or during testing (i.e.,
                in the SalaryPredictor's classify method). If set to True, all preprocessing
                attributes like imputers and OneHotEncoders must be fit before transforming
                any features to numerical representations. If set to False, should NOT fit
                any preprocessors, and only use their transform methods.
        
        Returns:
            np.ndarray:
                Numpy Array composed of numerical features converted from the raw inputs.
